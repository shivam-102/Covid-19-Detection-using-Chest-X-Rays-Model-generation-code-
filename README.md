# Covid-19-Detection-using-Chest-X-Rays-Model-generation-code-

This project compares a conventional CNN model with a vgg16 model to create the best classifier for covid detection using x-ray pictures. The use of predefined models like vgg16, vgg14, can make classification models more stable in specific cases.  The generated model was further used to develop a mobile application using Android Studio.
